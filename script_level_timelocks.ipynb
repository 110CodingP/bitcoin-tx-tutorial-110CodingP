    "In this section we'll cover how to create a transaction level timelocks with `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` (`OP_CTLV`) and `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` (`OP_CSV`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Script level timelocks are an essential part of many layer 2 protocols such lightning HTLC transactions and cross chain atomic swaps. They build off `nLocktime` and `nSequence` by allowing the script verification to check that the spending transaction has those fields set to specific values. \n",

    "This section assumes knowledge of P2WPKH transactions and transaction-level timelocks.\n",

    "### Reading\n",
    "- https://medium.com/summa-technology/bitcoins-time-locks-27e0c362d7a1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "We will use the same scenario as with the transaction-level timelock example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Kim is an old grandmother who wants to pass some of her wealth (0.1 btc) on to her grandson, Peter. However, Peter is still a child and Kim doesn't trust Peter to spend his bitcoin wisely. Kim would rather wait until Peter turns 18 before he's able to spend his bitcoin. Kim doesn't know how much longer she'll be around for, and she doesn't trust anyone else to handle her money. To give Peter bitcoin in a way which will only allow him to spend it once he's 18, Kim will do this by giving Peter a signed transaction for 0.1 btc with an absolute timelock set to expire on his 18th birthday.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that 1 year corresponds to about 50,000 blocks. To save us having to mine tens of thousands of regtest blocks (which may take a few minutes), we'll instead suppose Peter's 18th birthday is happening much sooner, at block 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we achieved this by using transaction-level timelocks. There were a some potential downsides of this solution however:\n",
    "- Although Peter has a valid signed transaction from Kim, it is possible that she, or someone with access to her private key, may spend the input before Peter is able to broadcast his transaction. \n",
    "- Since the timelocks were on a transaction level, any additional outputs would be encumbered by the same timelock. \n",
    "- Peter has to safely store the signed transaction until it can be broadcast.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better solution in this case would be to use script-level timelocks. The OP_CODES `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`  \n",
    "and `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` are included in the redeemScript and can enforce that the spending transaction uses a specific value for `nLocktime` or `nSequence` respectively. "

    "In the scenario we just covered, Kim could have achieved the same outcome but using a relative timelock instead. The only difference would be that the delay would be specified relative to when the input was confirmed, rather than the absolute block height. \n",
