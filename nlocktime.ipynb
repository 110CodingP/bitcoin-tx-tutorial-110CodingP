    "Kim is an old grandmother who wants to pass some of her wealth (0.1 btc) on to her grandson, Peter. However, Peter is still a child and Kim doesn't trust Peter to spend his bitcoin wisely. Kim would rather wait until Peter turns 18 before he's able to spend his bitcoin. Kim doesn't know how much longer she'll be around for, and she doesn't trust anyone else to handle her money. To give Peter bitcoin in a way which will only allow him to spend it once he's 18, Kim will do this by giving Peter a signed transaction for 0.1 btc with an absolute timelock set to expire on his 18th birthday.\n",
