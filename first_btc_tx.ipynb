    "## Introduction\n",
    "Transactions are perhaps the most important part of the bitcoin protocol. All the other aspects of the bitcoin protocol ultimately serve to verify, secure, and agree upon the order of bitcoin transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first bitcoin transactions created by Satoshi are very different to the typical bitcoin transaction you'd see on the blockchain today. Over the years there have been a number of upgrades to the bitcoin protocol that have resolved issues such as transaction malleability, and introduced new features such as timelocks, and schnorr signatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how the various types of bitcoin transactions work, it's helpful to understand how the earliest transaction types worked, and how the new features got intoduced. What may otherwise seem like a strangely written protocol with counterintuitive behaviour begins to make more sense when appreciating that all the upgrades have been implemented in such a way to avoid causing a hardfork. In other words, any valid bitcoin transactions using the newer features must still be valid from the point of view of the earliest bitcoin node versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this view in mind, we'll start by looking at with the very first transaction types, then work our way chronologically through the various upgrades to arrive at the latest transaction types and features used today. "

    "## The first bitcoin transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Legacy bitcoin transactions have just four main components: the version, inputs, outputs, and locktime. To illustrate each of these fields and what they do, we'll go through an example using the first ever bitcoin transaction at January 11, 2009 at 7:30 PM PST. It was a transfer of 10 BTC from Satoshi Nakamoto to Hal Finney.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transaction spent a UTXO that was mined directly by Satoshi, where the block reward was 50 BTC. The transaction had two outputs, one to Hal Finney for 10 BTC, and a change output for 40 BTC.\n",
